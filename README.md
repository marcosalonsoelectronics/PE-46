Files associated to video Power Electronics #46: Comparison of Open-loop versus Closed-loop Characteristics of a DC-DC Converter

Available at: https://youtu.be/4T_Uzn9vleI

In this video we study the effect of closed-loop operation on the dynamic characteristics of a DC-DC converter, namely control to output transfer function, input impedance, output impedance, and audiosusceptibility. We see that the result is very similar to that obtain in closed-loop audio amplifiers: the input impedance increases, the output impedance decreases, and the audiosusceptibility decreases as well. Therefore, the converter becomes more ideal when operated in closed loop.
